    "1. Open a browser to the Python website and download the Windows installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Double click on the downloaded file and install Python for all users, and ensure that Python is added to your path.Click on Install now to begin. Adding Python to the path will enable us to use the Python interpreter from any part of the filesystem. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the installation is complete, click Disable path length limit and then Close. Disabling the path length limit means we can use more than 260 characters in a file path.\n",

    "4. Click Close to end the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to set the path do the following:-\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, after adding the Python to the Environment variable, let’s check if the Python is running anywhere in the windows or not. To do this open CMD and type Python. If the environment variable is set then the Python command will run otherwise not."
