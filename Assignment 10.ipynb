    "#### Answer:\n",
    "#### In Python, the built-in function used to open a file is also called open().The open() function takes two arguments: the first is the filename, including the path to the file, and the second is the mode in which to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are the different modes of opening a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1:\"r\" (Read mode): This is the default mode, which opens a file for reading. If the file does not exist, it will throw a FileNotFoundError. This mode is used when you want to read data from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2:\"w\" (Write mode): This mode opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. This mode is used when you want to write data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3:\"a\" (Append mode): This mode opens a file for writing as well, but instead of overwriting the file, it appends the new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. This mode is useful when you want to add new data to the end of an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4:\"x\" (Exclusive creation mode): This mode opens a file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. If the file exists, it will throw a FileExistsError. This mode is useful when you want to create a new file and ensure that it does not overwrite an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5:\"b\" (Binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. This is typically used when working with non-text files, such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6:\"t\" (Text mode): This is the default mode and is used to open a file in text mode. This mode is used when working with text files, such as .txt files.\n",
    "\n",
    "7:\"+\" (Read and Write mode): This mode opens a file for both reading and writing. This mode is useful when you want to read and write to the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these modes, you simply pass them as a string as the second argument to the open() function. For example, to open a file called \"myfile.txt\" in read mode, you would use:\n",
    "file = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")"

    "In Python, the close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to close a file after you are finished working with it because it releases the resources that were being used to keep the file open. When a file is open, the operating system allocates certain resources to it, such as memory and file descriptors. If the file is not closed properly, these resources may not be released, which can lead to memory leaks or other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you try to open a file that is already open, you may get a FileNotFoundError or a PermissionError. Therefore, it is good practice to close files when you are done using them."

    "#### Answer:\n",
    "The with statement in Python is used with the open() function to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite (block of code) finishes executing, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement provides a way to simplify code that uses files by eliminating the need to explicitly close the file using the close() function. Instead, it automatically closes the file when the suite of the with statement is finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using with statement and open() together is that it ensures that the file is always properly closed, even if an exception is raised within the suite of the with statement. This is because the with statement guarantees that the file is closed when the block of code within it completes, regardless of how control exits the block (e.g. normal completion, break, return, or an exception). This can help prevent memory leaks and other resource issues that can arise from leaving files open unintentionally.\n",

    "In summary, using with statement and open() together provides a more concise and safer way of working with files in Python."
