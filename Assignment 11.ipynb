    "#### Answer:\n",
    "In Python, an Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an Exception occurs, Python stops executing the program and raises an error message that describes the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as when trying to perform an operation that is not possible, accessing an object that does not exist, or when there is an issue with input/output operations, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a Syntax Error occurs when the Python interpreter is unable to understand and execute the code because the code does not follow the syntax rules of the Python language. Syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code, which means that they occur before the program is executed. These errors are typically due to issues such as missing or extra brackets, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors is that Exceptions occur during the execution of the program, whereas Syntax Errors occur during the parsing of the code. Syntax errors can be identified and fixed before the program is executed, while Exceptions can occur at runtime and must be handled in order to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that Syntax Errors are typically caused by mistakes made by the programmer, while Exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect user input or unexpected behavior of external libraries."
